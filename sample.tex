\section{Gray word font}

It is created using software Gray word library generator from DWIN. It has greater experience than 0 word font. For gray word font we have to use 8bit encapsulation.

% The \includegraphcs command is provided (implemented) by the graphicx package

\section{Save variable in Nor Flash}

Address of nor flash, it must be an even number, the range is 0x000000 - 0x027FFE, and then one address corresponds to 2 bytes, that is the total capacity is 320KB.\\

\emph{for NOR flash database site \\
Each ID corresponds to 2KWords memory with ID range of 0 - 79.
The database is located in on-chip NOR FLASH of 160KWords (320 KB). It
can be used to save user data or DWIN OS program library files.}
