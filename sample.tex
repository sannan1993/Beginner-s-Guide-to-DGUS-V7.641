\section{Flash Memory}
The LCD have total of 16MBytes(Mega Bytes) Flash memory for all content including fonts,images,icons,animation etc. This memory is divided into 64 id or subspaces, 0 to 63, each of 256KB size.

The files in the DWIN\_SET folder are stored here for execution. each file in the folder occupies the subspace correspoding to its name, e.g the '1.bin' files goes to the 1 id/subspace and '32.icl' to 32 and so on. If the file is larger then 256KB it will blead to the next regin. For example if '32.icl' is 1 MB, then it will occupie the 32,33,34 and 35 regin.

\section{Gray word font}
\subsection{Creating Font}
Open DGUS Software, go to welcome '1' and select the grey font generator '2'.

\end{figure}
Select Font '1' to use and then enable the sizes whcih you want to use '2', the horizontal size is same as the index (size of font) and the vertical is 2 times of horizontal size. You can note which sizes you have with these valves to use in DGUS software. '3' save the font as '1.bin' this will be used as 'Font ID' in software.

It is created using software Gray word library generator from DWIN. It has greater experience than 0 word font. For gray word font we have to use 8bit encapsulation.

% The \includegraphcs command is provided (implemented) by the graphicx package

\section{data send serially}

\emph{Note: First of all enable Touch variable automatic upload 1=On from system configuration. This is needed to send data from Syncrodata return and return key code functions of DGUS software}

following image shows the command through which data can be send/receive from MCU. 
\\ Following command will change the page. (it will make use of system variable)

\section{Save variable in Nor Flash}

Address of nor flash, it must be an even number, the range is 0x000000 - 0x027FFE, and then one address corresponds to 2 bytes, that is the total capacity is 320KB.\\

\emph{for NOR flash database site \\
Each ID corresponds to 2KWords memory with ID range of 0 - 79.
The database is located in on-chip NOR FLASH of 160KWords (320 KB). It
can be used to save user data or DWIN OS program library files.}
